-How your script handles arguments and options?

It makes sure there are at least two arguments: the search string and the file.
The script uses getopts to process command-line flags
After that, it gets the search word we want to search after  and file name from the remaining arguments.
check the file
then reads the file line by line


-Supporting regex or other options like (-i, -c, -l)?

Extend getopts to include new flags
for C, I will  modify the script to count how many lines match and print that number.
The core flow (options â†’ validation )  would stay intact, but the search aspect will grow branches.


-What was hardest to implement and why?

the hardest was the options part  implementint it  was trickey of how you should  handling combined flags also, because i didn't understand how im supposed to do it in the first but i got it after a bit  of search
